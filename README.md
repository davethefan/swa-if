Dogs of War 
A short interactive fiction story

This story forms Part VII of 'The Burner Effect' series of 
short, Sci-Fi stories I have written, that are kindly
hosted on the excellent SWATeam's website.

This is a short story written with a 
'choose your adventure' style, with multiple storylines.

Requirements:
Squiffy (http://github.com/textadventures/squiffy)

While in development, you'll need to either download the Squiffy 
client, or copy and paste the text into the the web-based editor 
(http://textadventures.co.uk/squiffy/editor).

The completed version will be hosted online, and playable through 
your browser.

I must add that this is written as part of an ongoing story, it may
help to read up on the backstory.
They are to be read in this order:

1. The curious case of the maimed bomber

I could probably include them in my git, but for now I'm enjoying giving
my friends the traffic.
