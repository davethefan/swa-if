----------------------------------------------------------

TV Screens all over The City cut short for one second, a brief of blackness as a new video was 
input to the queue, and forced to start playing; there were  no transitions.
A cold hard shove into broadcast.
For that moment, the entire city looked as if it had been rebooted.
'Ladies, Gentlemen - and hybrids...'

The Bootwasher: A downtown bar with a homely but lively atmosphere - serving fine lagers and locally brewed ales, a home from home for the patrons, and a pleasant environment to walk into for the first time - even the two suits at the bar, talking into each others shoulders conspiritorially didn't look too out of place amongst the rockers - young and old - hovering around the orb-pool table.
The TV above the bar offered a display of the Red Zone vs South Quadrant Utd. football match, and an overly-excitable audio description of the events of the game spoke loud enough to those who were interested enough to get close, but didn't distract those with no interest in the transactional exchange of an inflated ball.

'Chelson. To Blark. Back to Chelson.... he's speeding up now - breaking into his famous sprint. 
Along the inside - he's in with a chance here - just a little bit further, he knows it! He's in range now...takes the shot! it's flying hard... it's going..' - his excited, nasal commentary giddy with anticipation.

For a fraction of a second, the screen blacked out and was replaced by a news report.
'We interrupt your viewing experience to bring you Breaking News.' the Breaking News echoed dramatically, accompanied by the kind of intense sound effect used in a movie trailer to build suspense.
The anticlimax of a news anchor, in her drab, unappealing suit; stern faced and serious - blue background, with an image of a Comms device with a green wireframe grid around it, and a sequence of binary that when translated, equated to random nonsense.

'We are hearing reports from multiple sources worldwide, that an as of yet un-named politicans mobile comms device has been used in an attempted attack--'
'What the hell is this?!' one of the patrons at the bar yelled. 'Turn it back!'
The barman, just seconds ago was equally engrossed in the game, and just as confused as his peer.
'I haven't touched it. This better not last long.'
'What about other channels?'
'Nah, when they lock them out for news - it takes over every channel. Fucking annoying.'
'Damn straight. You pay good money for that shit, if you wanted the news, you'd look for it yourself, eh?' he was really down, this single incident has probably ruined this patrons day. 
He stamped his fist on the bar in anger. A little tantrum.
'Here, I don't usually do this - but for your inconvinience, have a beer on me. 
Just don't tell the others.' the barman winked.

He felt a little guilty that the guy had just come to watch the game and have a beer, obviously he wasn't responsible for the news report, but he did appreciate that he'd come to watch the game in his bar.
'Cheers bud. Thanks' - his face lit up.

Behind him, in their own private vocal struggle were two men in suits. 
'The law won't allow it, I'm telling you.' Judge Mark Galnington is in a heated conversation with Don While; a local lawyer.
'The law?! The law is based on an archaic system - the law we are using predates even the existence of these... monsters.'
'There has been additions to it in light of -'
'Additions! They've amended the Hate Crime Act to include them. What other additions?
'Where are their rights to be treated fairly at work, their right to medical care? The system as it stands says if you hit or kill a human that has animal genetics - then you will be punished. 
Mildly at that. That's it. That's their acceptance in society, but they want rights because how they are treat hurts their feelings: they don't deserve rights - they're part animal. Animals don't have feelings'
'Uh-huh.' Galnington boredly agreed. He'd heard this rant before; comes out after roughly 4 beers.
Dons' half hour of hybrid-bashing.
To Galnington, it sounded just the same as any other xenophobia he'd heard before, and he had no time for it. 
'We're at WAR with these - have been for over a hundred years now, and they want us to give them rights? Based on what? Their fraction of human DNA?'  - he droned on, until Judge Mark Galnington gave a retort that he probably not remember in the morning, but was drunkenly heartfelt.
'We created them...I mean, we as humans created them - they're our responsibility, Don. If we hadn't have fucked around with genetics, they wouldn't be here - but we did, and they are - they were bred to fight, that was what they were built for. We have a duty of care towards them.
What else do you expect them to do?' he breathed in, and Don opened his mouth to talk. 
Mark silenced him with a finger to the air.
'I'm not finished, man. They've gone about it all wrong - the first batches were oversexed. They liked to fuck a lot.
They fixed the problem eventually, but that still means a few thousand soldiers, stationed mostly on camp - but coming into contact with the public for three years, before they found the gene that affected their promiscuosuness.

They started interbreeding really quickly, and soon after that - humans started taking an interest in them and experimented with them; the porn industry, being the cinematographic pioneers they were, embraced the movement and were the first to advocate hybrids in film.
It was considered 'cool' to have a hybrid partner - and it didn't take long before you got deformed feral hybrids - this is a hundred and fifty years ago, remember? They didn't live like we do now.  
Burner Security release a new cycle every fifteen years; we're living in Generation X. The tenth generation man.'
'That's fucking bullshit. Where'd you read that? Conspiracy theory bullshit - you want to lay off the forbidden literature, mate.'

The news station were still forcing their report onto televisual frequencies; they were displaying the latest messages that were been forwarded to them.
'If you have, or know anyone who has recieved one of these messages - pleased forward it to 202. 
It's free on all networks worldwide.' the anchor advertised.

Patron and barman, Mick Hoon and Charlie Werk, respectively; we'll intrude on the dialogue as Mick is asking:
'So they sent out, how many?'
'They don't know for sure yet, but estimate is around 4,000 so far.'
'Over 4000 text messages sent, from his phone?'
'Well, his number. Yeah.'
'And they were all offensive, nasty messages?'
'Yeah, pretty much. Look at that one, there.' and nodded to the screen: You're a fucking chickenshit, mate
Mick laughed, he didn't care about the game - this was much more entertaining.
'I'd be so pissed off if I got that message!' he hooted
'Oh thats worse!' Charlie laughed as the a new entry appeared: 'I'm annoying your children right now'
Mick didn't like that one so much and thought it might have been in bad taste - he wondered if they were targeted, but the woman on the news said that some men have got them aimed at women, and the other way round - so probably not.
His mood was soon lifted with the next entry which made him howl with laughter so hard, that it Mark and Don looked over from their private, ethical dialogue to Mick, catching his glaze.
'Oh sorry' he chuckled 'some of these are fucking brilliant.' and pointed with his big thumb to the screen.
'Some of what?' Don asked, squinting to read the TV screen in the top corner of the bar, pressing a small metal button on the side of his head to adjust his retina to long-sighted mode to read the screen.
'Some major politicians phone has been hacked, and someone, or some-thing has sent out thousands of abusive texts from his number to random numbers - the news showing the ones that people have reported. Theres' been about four-thousand so far!'
Don and Galnington looked at each other, and back again.
'Do you mind if we...' Don motioned with his hand, 'can we join you?'
'No no, come over. It's a right laugh.'
the two pulled their stools over to see the screen, introduced themselves - and the four spent the evening howling with laughter, harder than they had for a long time - watching the coverage until it got light.

# perhaps put a couple of other scenes in here, and then:
Barman looking up from his Comms device.
'Oh, Mick. I forgot to tell you. The score was nil-nil. 
'A fruitless game then - thank goodness for political subterfuge and character defamation, eh?' Mick laughed.

#Phil was rewatching King Judge Gruntles' appearance on Birk Bockles' TV show; as well as The Moorkoft Bombing,  Greenflames' SMS attack, Cora, and of course what to do with Simon Burner - preventing a war he'd helped to instigate for many years was also on his agenda

'I'm going to seperate man from beast' - unrolls a towel with surgical equipment on.


'Get back! Get back!' the soldier yelled.
A mid-street skirmish had broken out on a busy Saturday afternoon - the area was rife with shoppers, those who beleived in a face-to-face market system were very cheery: almost a party atmosphere - shoppers at stalls showing items for sale to complete strangers in glee, trying clothes on and taking photos of each other - the festival-like bazaar atmosphere was loaded with joy.
'Here, look at this!' you could hear - people bumbling with pleasure at the wares available to touch and interact with.
The joys of the real world, something you could touch, see, smell - and not digital data that only exited in code and airwave transmissions.

Two cracks from above plunged the whole market into silence - everybody there knew that sound, gunshots.
A collective scream, and the entire standing community became a laying-face down on the ground community at the exact same moment.
Except for Phil, and his platoon.
'We are not here to kill civilians. We are not monsters!' he announced to the citizens.
'I want everybody to slowly, and calmly crawl forward, behind us. Keep low, and keep your heads down.'
The sound of shuffling as the shoppers imitated slugs to crawl behind the soldiers. Were they soldiers? They don't look like Human Army, or rebels. Their leader is wearing a suit!
'The enemy we are fighting, are Burner Security hybrids. They are rogue fighters.' his right-hand man yelled.
A female voice cirping over the radio:
'I got one.' Click.
Another gunshot from the rooftops.
'He's down.' Click.
Phil tried hard to remain focused, the soldiers under his command relied on his keeping his head together: but all he could think of was Rachel.
Don't let issues of the heart detract you, Phil. Stay focused, in the moment - you're in a battle now. Get you and your men out alive.
I need to jump to her, after this -  I'll see her.
Carry on with the battle! Fight on!
I need to fix this, I have questions I need answering.
Think of the bigger picture. Stop Burner Security escalating this war!
A side-effect of his glasses is that they were able to run semi-autonomously, and anything that was about to happen would alert him, which meant that his thoughts were able to drift, and this right now was a bad thing.

Rachel had broken up with him, for reasons for which she had given him - but he was sure they were excuses; copypastes from the generic book of breakup reasons.
She did say he was never there, though - which he could not deny. 
'I love you' he intoned, over and over - in the vague hope that she would hear it, and acknowledge it. For what good it'd do.

He fumbled in his side-satchel for metal cannisters, clanking against each other, until he lifted one out of his bag; an adreno-shot, this'll get you back in the zone. He popped off the plastic lid with his thumb to reveal a small hypodermic needle, and plunged it into his thigh, and tapped the chrome metal button on top of the cannister, a quick hiss as the adrenaline poured into his bloodstream, igniting and revitalising him instantly; his vision becoming slow motion, movements out of the corner of his eye became focused - he leveled his gun, and fired three shots in a 45 degree arc - killing three hybrids before they had chance to spot him.
He quickly scanned around to see if he was been watched, and ran to one of the civilians who was wearing a drab coat that was the fashion amongst the popular culture.
'Sir, lend me coat, please.'
'Wh-why, certainly brave soldier' the man replied and shuffled out of his coat.
Phil wrappped the coat around him, and laid face down on the ground, and shuffled towards the section of crossroad that the half-human, half animal hybrids were pouring from.
